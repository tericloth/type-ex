		<p>Monster Jam is a live motorsport event tour and television show operated by Feld Entertainment.[1] The series is sanctioned under the umbrella of the United States Hot Rod Association (USHRA) and takes place primarily in the United States. Although individual event formats can vary greatly based on the "intermission" entertainment, the main attraction is always the racing and freestyle competitions by monster trucks.</p>

		<p>Monster Jam fans are loyal and dedicated because they enjoy access to the performers and their amazing machines. Every fan attending a Monster Jam event is given the opportunity to meet the stars of the show during the unique "Pit Party" and autograph sessions. The drivers of Monster Jam will stay at the "Pit Parties" until the last autograph is signed.</p>
